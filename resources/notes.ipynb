    "# Acoustic Emissions\n",
    "Acoustic emissions is an ultrasound wave (20 kHz - 1 MHz) is generated by energy from a source within a material.\n",
    "\n",
    "This wave is then recorded by sensors (accelerometer / piezo-electronics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to listen to active defects in structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main issues: \n",
    "- Signal processing is a big issue, since AE signals are usually very weak.\n",
    "- Commercial AE only estimates qualitative damage levels / how long the components will last. It can't give quantitative results."
