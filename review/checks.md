# Checks
## I2C bus connection
- Are all I2C bus signals connected to the output

## Footprints
- Are all footprints
	- Corresponding to the footprint in the datasheet
	- Is the actual component the right one (right capacitance / resistance / LCSC PN)

## Temperature Sensor
- Check the plane requirements below the sensor.

## Connectors
- Check connector orientation and distance
