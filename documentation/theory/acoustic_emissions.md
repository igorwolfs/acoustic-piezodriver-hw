# Acoustic Emission Concepts
### HSU-Nielsen source
Used often as a calibration source for AE measurement.
Is an acoustic emission of a fracturing graphite lead.
- Amplitude should be at least 80 dB reference voltage for a 1 mV Vref, and a system gain of 80 dB.
- Checks the accuracy of the source location setup.
	- Determining value of the acoustic wavespeed for the object being monitored.
