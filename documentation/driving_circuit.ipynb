    "# Piezo power supply\n",
    "In order to supply maximum power for the piezo along the resonance point, we need\n",
    "- A square-wave generator (stm32)\n",
    "- A low-pass filter (optional)\n",
    "- A FET\n",
    "- A FET driver (to drive 2.5 amps to the piezo-element at resonance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 1 \n",
    "- Using a bldc driver board / buy some random inverter board, and drive the piezo-electric using a voltage source.\n",
    "\t- Make sure to check the voltage wave coming from the inverter, to check if a band-pass filter is needed.\n",
    "- Switching frequency:\n",
    "\t- Dead time is 520 ns, so 1 us is about 1 MHz which is definitely too slow for our purpose.\n",
    "- Most of the regular stuff doesn't switch at MHz frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- Too slow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 2: single fet drive\n",
    "- Use a UCC2751x OR a UCC27611 as a FET driver\n",
    "\t- the UCC27611 \n",
    "\t\t- has better rise / fall times and propagation delays\n",
    "\t\t- It also has built-in circuitry for level shifting\n",
    "\t\t- Is really expensive\n",
    "\t- the UCC27611\n",
    "\t\t- Doesn't have level shifting (but we also don't need it)\n",
    "\t- fall + rise + dead times here are (td1+tr+td2+tf) * 10 = 10+20+20 = 50 ns, our switching period needs to be (1/2MHz) / 2 = 250 ns [since each side of the piezo-electric needs switch every 250 ns]. 250 ns / 50 = 5 times the rise + fall time. \n",
    "\t\t- Given that we really need a sine-wave, and we want to filter out the higher frequency components anyways, it's acceptable.\n",

    "## Solution 3\n",
    "- Use a 4 x 1EDN8550BXTSA1 to form a full-bridge AC-drive\n",
    "\t- Add bootstrap circuitry for high-side supply.\n",
    "\t- Low side supply simply connected to PWM output.\n",
    "- Add 4 x NDS355AN as FET's\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can we use a single PWM signal for both drivers without creatinga short?\n",
    "No we can't, otherwise you need \n",
    "- Dead time\n",
    "- Separation between the 2 comparators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- Use another model, this model seems to not have any decent spice models available, only pspice.\n",
