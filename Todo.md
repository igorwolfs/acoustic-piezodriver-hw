# Amplifier
## Preamplifiers
- High impedance
- Enhance signal power with minimal noise addition (similar to an LNA)
- Usually highly linear

## Amplifiers
- Focus is pure power addition.
- Low-impedance


# Analog signal processing
- Add an analog integrator and compare with the digital one over frequency range

# Digital signal processing
- Add a small FPGA with the appropriate signal processing present.

# Acoustic emission simulations
- Check if you can use OpenEMS for propagation of acoustic waves in solids.
