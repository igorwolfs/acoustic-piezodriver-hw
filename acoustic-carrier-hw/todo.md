# Ethernet
- Validate the use of 33 nF capacitors, check the effect of it
- Route the KSZ9031, base yourself on the LogicBone-example


# DDR3L
- Add filtering to the DDR-power supply
- Add 1.3 V / 2 reference through resistive divider to the FPGA

# Power
- Go through the LTSpice model for the buck-converters, check why there's a difference


# USB
- Add USB PHY
- Add USB power supply to FPGA board (5 V)

# LED


# Connectors to power board
- Check whether it's best to put connectors above / below the board to connect to power board
- Foresee 4 PWM connectors to power board
- Check which connectors to place below FPGA board to connect to power-board
