Hi all,

I designed this PCB as a part of my non-destructive ultrasound testing prototype for materials and welds.

Main components:

* Gigabit Ethernet
* LPDDR3
* USB2.0 (up to 480 Mbps), USB-C connector
* A few PMOD connectors
* 35 MHz ADC with analog frontend, with 2 possible analog connectors. (input frequency is meant to be between 0.1 MHz - 10 MHz)
   * RJ45 with magnetics.
   * RJ45 with capacitors for DC isolation.

Stackup:

* 6-layer stackup, layer 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 together.
* SIG - GND - GND - SIG / PWR - GND - SIG.
* Signals impedance matched / length matched where required.

I would be super-grateful if you could take a look. My main points of concern are:

* The frequency roloff at my ADC frontend.
* Coupling between signal traces of the LPDDR3-peripheral. The traces are close. I only have 2 layers to route them on though and I believe this is the best I can do.
* Traces underneath RJ45 connectors with magnetics.

Thanks!
