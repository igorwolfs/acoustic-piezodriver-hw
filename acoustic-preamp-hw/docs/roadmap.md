# Roadmap
## Initial prototyping of front-end board

The issue here is we don't really know the mechanical loading, so we don't know how much of the mechanical energy will be converted into electrical energy.
Thus the best way to work would be.

1. Design the piezo-driver first
2. Buy both a receiver and transmitter piezo
	- Match the impedance of the transmitter piezo
3. Check what voltage levels come out of the receiver piezo when exciting the material
4. Build the analog front-end accordingly.
